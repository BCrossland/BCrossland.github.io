                              The two acres of land on which the house stands were originally owned by Lord Douglas of
                              Douglas and were sold by the Countess of Home to William Stiven, an Accountant in
                              Dundee, on 8 th May 1866, with a Feu of £29. The land had previously been part of the “Farm
                              of Claypotts”. Taken from the Title Deeds.

                                <br/>
                                As well as being a well-connected Dundee businessman, William Stiven, through his father-
                                in-law, was also involved with a Flax Mill in Dura Den, near Cupar in Fife. He was also one of
                                the original contributors to the establishment of the Albert Institute (now The McManus
                                Gallery) in Dundee. He bought 3 shares at £10 each.

                                In the Lands Valuation Roll for the year commencing Whitsunday 1865, there is an entry for
                                an unnamed Dwelling House and Office at “Hare Craig” with William Stiven listed as the
                                Proprietor. There are six properties mentioned under this heading, but only two have names
                                – Rock Lodge and Tay Cliff. This is likely to have been the house Stiven subsequently named
                                Oakville.

                                  The first reference to the name of the property itself is in the 1869 Directory of Dundee,
                                  where it is called Oakville and owned by Stiven (in the previous years’ Directory, he was
                                  listed as having a house in “West Ferry” – which, given the entry in the 1865 Lands
                                  Valuation, is likely to be Oakville). From this, it would seem that the house was built around
                                  mid-1866.

                                  The death at Oakville of Beatrice Stiven on 31st January 1875, daughter of William and Mary, is noted in the Northern Warder of 2nd February 1875. She was aged 2 ½. Her death certificate records “Diphtheria” as the cause of death. <br> <br>
                                  The same newspaper, on March 12th notes that Mrs William Stiven has given birth to an (unnamed) son at Oakville, a mere few weeks after the death of Beatrice. That child, Alfred Woodhouse Stiven, was born on the 5th March.

                                  An article from the Montrose Standard and Angus and Mearns Register dated September 5th 1879 states that the purchase price was £6,523 and that the Church “had received a great many subscriptions from the friends of the late Bishop both in Scotland and England”, although at that stage, there was still a shortfall of some £300, which the Church were confident of making up though further subscriptions.

                                  By the time the 1880 Directory was published, Bishop Jermyn is shown as living at “Forbes Court”, so it appears the change of name took place shortly after it was purchased by the Church. <br> <br>
                                  It is interesting to note that in the case of both Oakville and Forbes Court, the house names were followed by “Harecraigs”. There is a Harecraigs House (still standing) to the south of the building – there is evidence that the area in which Oakville/Forbes Court stands was known as Harecraigs at the time.

                                  The Jermyn family were recorded on that years’ Census as living at Le Chalet, Braddons Road East, Tormoham, Torquay, Devon. The Head of the house is recorded as Sophia Ogle, a Widow aged 83. Her daughter, also Sophia (Jermyn), aged 57. Also, Agnes Jermyn, Visitor, aged 43. There is no mention of Hugh Jermyn in this return, although it can be assumed this is where he was residing at this time. It is known that the Bishop suffered from spells of poor health and spent time away from Dundee as part of his recuperation.

                                    “Forbes Court is a memorial to the late Bishop Forbes. On his death it was proposed to build a See House, but the villa now called after him happened to be for sale, and it was decided to buy it. Situated about three miles from Dundee, to the west of Broughty-Ferry, the position of the house is extremely pleasant. It stands on somewhat high ground overlooking the Firth of Tay, with Tayport and a portion of the lower Fife hills beyond. The view from the windows on a clear day, when St. Andrews may also be seen, is magnificent. The garden, of about two acres in extent, is well laid out; groups of trees and sloping lawn to the south and west, with kitchen and herbaceous garden behind. Of the interior of the house, it may be said that it is well planned, and has a good stair-case – the dining-room, drawing-room, and a very small study looking to the south. There is no library and the chapel was formed and successfully adapted from two little narrow slips”

                                          Picture undated but Bishop Jermyn is clearly older than in the earlier 1889 picture. This picture was used in the 1897 article so from that year or earlier. From the National Portrait Gallery. The biography of Bishop Jermyn suggests he did not enjoy good health towards the end of his life. The difference between this picture and that from 1889 shows that quite markedly.

                            The Dundee Evening Telegraph of the same day noted that “for a long time, the Primus had been in failing health and he had suffered from debility due to his great age” and that “he had resigned the Primacy in the summer of 1901 and since that time had taken little or no active part in the affairs of the Church. Some weeks ago, a serious decline in his strength was noted, and it was seen the end was near. The Primus, however, lingered until the early hours of this morning, when he passed away peacefully”.

                    On the 27th April, the marriage of George J Sherriff, second lieutenant, North Scottish R.G.A to Kathleen Grant Barclay, only daughter of Mr and Mrs Grant Barclay, Cambus Lodge, Broughty Ferry took place at the Private Chapel, Forbes Court, Broughty Ferry. They were married by the Most Rev, the Bishop of Brechin (Primus) assisted by the Rev. H.T.J Waring, rector of St. Mary’s, Broughty Ferry.
                    <br> <br>
                    Interestingly, a letter has been found from Sheill and Small Solicitors Dundee dated 5th March 1917 to a Lt. George J Sherriff, Broughty Castle, Broughty Ferry, setting out the terms on which his Life Insurance Company (Standard Life) would deal with his premiums whilst he was on active service abroad.  Presumably the same Lt Sherriff who was married a few weeks later at Forbescourt.

                    In the 22nd May edition of The Scotsman, an advert appears for a “House-Laundress (young) required middle of June; help given; no shirts or collars; 4 maids; general suitable; fare paid. Mrs Robberds, Forbescourt, Broughty Ferry.”

Meanwhile, nearby 23 Inverleith Place was the home of the Rector of St. James’ Episcopalian Church, John Sharp. On that day, Kenneth Mackenzie, Bishop of Argyll and the Isles is recorded as a Visitor there. That perhaps suggests a gathering of Churchmen in Edinburgh at that time.

                    In recognition of his 25 years as Bishop, a fund was established to purchase a motor car for Bishop Robberds which would “relieve the strain of the constant travelling involved in the fulfilment of his official duties”. The object was to raise £1,000 which, as well as the car itself, would also allow for a garage at Forbescourt and a sum to meet running costs.

                    A portrait of Bishop Robberds which hangs at Glenalmond School, Perthshire. The portrait, which was unveiled in 1928, was commissioned by the School and painted by the Art Master of the time, Henry Daniel. Glenalmond has long enjoyed a close relationship with the Episcopalian Church.

                    In the Dundee Courier of 10th March, there is mention that “Right Rev. Kenneth Mackenzie, Bishop of Brechin, has purchased Fairfield, the West Ferry residence of the late Mr. David P How”. Fairfield House is a substantial mansion house in Fairfield Road, very close to Forbescourt.
                    <br> <br>
                    The Dundee Courier of 11th May 1942 carries a notice advising that “A Petition has been presented to the Court of Session (Petition Department) by the Right Reverend Kenneth Mackenzie, Bishop of Brechin, and others, Trustees for the Heritable Subjects now known as Forbescourt, Broughty Ferry, Angus, for authority to sell the said Heritable subjects”.
                    <br> <br>
                    No evidence has been found to suggest that the house was ever put on the market at this point, nor that the purchase of Fairfield proceeded, as Bishop Mackenzie appears to have continued to live in Forbescourt until his retirement in October 1943.

                      Eric Graham is consecrated Bishop of Brechin on 2nd May 1944 at St Paul’s Cathedral, Dundee. From his 1967 biography by his son-in-law, Robert Moltby, it would appear that Bishop Graham and his family were unable to move into Forbescourt immediately and were temporarily housed elsewhere.

                      Also included in the Electoral Registers was Cosmo S Graham, who lived at 85 Dundee Road until 1959. Although I can trace no evidence to support it, it would seem likely that Cosmo was related to Bishop Graham – possibly his son.

                    On Tuesday, August 29th, The Evening Telegraph, under the headline “Former Home Of Bishop Sold” carries the report;
                    <br> <br>
                    “The house at 85 Dundee Road, Broughty Ferry, former residence of the Bishop of Brechin, may become a boarding-house. The former Forbescourt was sold by public group today for the upset price of £2000. Purchasers were Messrs C. Muszka, 15, Ash Street, and M. Lukasiewicz, 32 Elgin Street, both of whom served with the Polish Forces during the war and remained in Dundee on demobilisation.
                    <br> <br>
                    Mr Muszka is a surveyor by profession, but in the meantime in partnership with his colleague as watchmakers. As yet they have no definite plans for the property, but have in mind the possibility of using it as a boarding-house once alterations have been carried out.
                    <br> <br>
                    “It will require some planning first,” Mr Muszka said after the sale.
                    <br> <br>
                    The house contains four public rooms, seven bedrooms, dressing-room, two bathrooms, kitchen premises, with modern central heating plant, and garage. Grounds extend to two acres and overlook the Tay estuary. Assessed rental is £150, and feu duty £29 12s 4d.
                    The sale was conducted in the office of Messrs R. C. Thomson & Murdoch, C.A., 64 Reform Street and Mr R. G. MacLean was auctioneer.”

                    A few weeks later, on November 25th, The Broughty Ferry Guide and Carnoustie Gazette reports that:
                    “Dundee Works Committee on Monday deferred a building licence application by Mrs Helen Reid to convert 85 Dundee Road, West Ferry (formerly Forbescourt, residence of the Bishop of Brechin), into four flats, three of which would be for letting. Estimated cost is £1440. Regarding applications for licences for work above £100, Convener Hossick told the Committee they had now only £2300 left of their quota for this year. Opportunity will be given for Mrs. Reid to submit a modified request at the next Committee meeting.”
                    <br> <br>
                    This latest report suggests that Messrs Muszka & Lukasiewicz may have sold the property almost immediately after buying it. Or that Mrs Helen Reid was acting as their agent in the application.
                    <br> <br>
                    The wording of the piece suggest that she was applying for a grant to convert the house, as opposed to submitting a Planning Application to have the work carried out at her own expense.
